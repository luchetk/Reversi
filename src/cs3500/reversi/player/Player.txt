 * The player interface will have the following:
 * fields:
 * - color
 * methods:
 * - getColor --> returns the player color of the player
 * - getCoordinatesOfMove --> determines where the user is going to move

 * NOTE: a controller will interact with this class to get the coordinates of the
 * move that the player is going to do. The player is an interface so that
 * a human or AI player can later extend it,with AI player having implementation
 * for getCoordinatesOfInformedMove which will determine more informed moves.
 * The player will get the coordinates of a move from a player click and then
 * each player will interact with its own controller and view. The controller
 * will determine these coordinates and will pass the associated player color
 * and coordinates to make a move using the model.
